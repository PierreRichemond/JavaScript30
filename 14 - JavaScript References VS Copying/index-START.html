    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
 let age = 100;
 let age2 = age
 console.log(age, age2) // 100 100
 age = 200
 console.log(age, age2) // 200 100

  let name = 'pierre';
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2) // Pierre Pierre
    name = 'paul'
    console.log(name, name2) // Paul Pierre

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team) // is the same

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
team[3] = 'lux'
  console.log(players, team) // both ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'lux']
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice(); // return the whole array original
team2[3] = 'lux'
  console.log(players, team2) // we have 2 diferent array, player is original, team2 is changed

// one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 =[].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
const captain = person;
captain.number = 99; //this edith the original object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
